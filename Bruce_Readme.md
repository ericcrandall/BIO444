# PopGenWithR

Collaboration Version of Population Genetics Text Book

## Background

Over the past four years, I have been teaching a course in population genetics at Miami University; in so doing I have developed (and continue to develop) materials, written in RMarkdown, that are increasingly becoming the *de facto* text for the course.  Rmd files for that effort are contained in this repository, along with a few associated files that are important for running these files.  At present, knitted html is not included in the repo; this may change in the future.

## Organization

The guts of the project are in the folder .Rmd; those files can be used, with minor editing to generate knitted files.  One complication will be in the yaml code for the bibliography and css; at present they point to files on my local machine; I am working on finding the best way to include them in the repo (suggestions are welcome).

There are three other directory of note:

1.  `RmdDevelopment` contains very crude files, not yet ready for prime time.
2.  `RmdProblems` is a folder in which I will be including practice problems as I develop them.
3.  `RmdChapters` will include master files that can be used to generate chapter-length segments, which will incorporate material from multiple sources into single html files.

## Contributing

I invite you to clone this repo and look it over.  If you do,please let me know.  I am still an amateur with github, but if you develop any enhancements or wish to make suggestions, I would welcome them.  Please [email me](mailto:cochrabj@miamioh.edu) if you have questions or suggestions.
