abstract = {We describe allelic variation at 28 loci in six Caribbean populations of four sympatric species of Drosophila. Within any one species the allelic frequencies are very similar from population to population, although there is evidence of local as well as regional genetic differentiation. The genetic distance is greater between populations from different islands than between populations of the same island. When the allelic frequencies are compared between different species, a remarkable pattern appears. In any pair of species nearly half of the loci have essentially identical allelic frequencies, while nearly the other half of the loci have different alleles and in different frequencies. The loci with nearly identical allelic frequencies are different when different pairs of species are compared. The patterns of allelic variation within and between species are inconsistent with the hypothesis that the variation is adaptively neutral. Migration or mutation cannot explain the patterns of genetic variation, either. Balancing natural selection is the main process maintaining protein polymorphisms in natural populations.},

We also detected a signal of strong positive selection in this region only in East Asians. Our data indicate that likely candidate targets of selection include rs12488302-T and its associated alleles-among which four are non-synonymous, including rs35455589-G in HYAL2, a gene related to the cellular response to ultraviolet-B irradiation. Furthermore, suggestive evidence supports latitude-dependent selection, implicating a role of ultraviolet-B. Interestingly, the distribution of rs35455589-G suggests that this allele was lost during the exodus of ancestors of modern Eurasians from Africa, and reintroduced to Eurasians from Neanderthals.},

We describe a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling procedure that efficiently samples a variant of the generalized skyline plot, given sequence data, and combines these plots to generate a posterior distribution of effective population size through time. We apply the Bayesian skyline plot to simulated data sets and show that it correctly reconstructs demographic history under canonical scenarios. Finally, we compare the Bayesian skyline plot model to previous coalescent approaches by analyzing two real data sets (hepatitis C virus in Egypt and mitochondrial DNA of Beringian bison) that have been previously investigated using alternative coalescent methods. In the bison analysis, we detect a severe but previously unrecognized bottleneck, estimated to have occurred 10,000 radiocarbon years ago, which coincides with both the earliest undisputed record of large numbers of humans in Alaska and the megafaunal extinctions in North America at the beginning of the Holocene.},

In particular the test of the hypothesis that the alleles being sampled are indeed selectively neutral will be considered. In view of the large amount of data currently being obtained by electrophoretic methods on allele frequencies and numbers, and the current interest in the possibility of extensive "non-Darwinian" evolution, such a sampling theory seems necessary.

abstract = {We describe extensions to the method of Pritchard et al. for inferring population structure from multilocus genotype data. Most importantly, we develop methods that allow for linkage between loci. The new model accounts for the correlations between linked loci that arise in admixed populations ("admixture linkage disequilibium"). This modification has several advantages, allowing (1) detection of admixture events farther back into the past, (2) inference of the population of origin of chromosomal regions, and (3) more accurate estimates of statistical uncertainty when linked loci are used. It is also of potential use for admixture mapping. In addition, we describe a new prior model for the allele frequencies within each population, which allows identification of subtle population subdivisions that were not detectable using the existing method. We present results applying the new methods to study admixture in African-Americans, recombination in Helicobacter pylori, and drift in populations of Drosophila melanogaster. The methods are implemented in a program, structure, version 2.0, which is available at http://pritch.bsd.uchicago.edu.},

abstract = {The Luria-Delbr{\"{u}}ck distribution is a classical model of mu-tations in cell kinetics. It is obtained as a limit when the probability of mutation tends to zero and the number of divisions to infinity. It can be interpreted as a compound Poisson distribution (for the number of muta-tions) of exponential mixtures (for the developing time of mutant clones) of geometric distributions (for the number of cells produced by a mutant clone in a given time). The probabilistic interpretation, and a rigourous proof of convergence in the general case, are deduced from classical results on Bellman-Harris branching processes. The two parameters of the Luria-Delbr{\"{u}}ck distribution are the expected number of mutations, which is the parameter of interest, and the relative fitness of normal cells compared to mutants, which is the heavy tail exponent. Both can be simultaneously estimated by the maximum likehood method. However, the computation becomes numerically unstable when the maximal value of the sample is large, which occurs frequently due to the heavy tail property. Based on the empirical probability generating function, robust estimators are proposed and their asymptotic variance is given. They are comparable in precision to maximum likelihood estimators, with a much broader range of calculability, a better numerical stability, and a negligible computing time.},

Consequently, we analysed a large mitochondrial and microsatellite dataset from the Antarctic fur seal Arctocephalus gazella, a species subjected to one of the most extreme examples of uncontrolled exploitation in history when it was reduced to the brink of extinction by the sealing industry during the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Classical bottleneck tests, which exploit the fact that rare alleles are rapidly lost during demographic reduction, yielded ambiguous results. In contrast, a strong signal of recent demographic decline was detected using both Bayesian skyline plots and Approximate Bayesian Computation, the latter also allowing derivation of posterior parameter estimates that were remarkably consistent with historical observations. This was achieved using only contemporary samples, further emphasizing the potential of Bayesian approaches to address important problems in conservation and evolutionary biology.},

abstract = {To study the mechanism of maintenance of polymorphism at major istocompatibility complex (MHC) loci, synonymous and nonsynonymous (amino cid-altering) nucleotide substitutions in the putative antigen-recognition ite (included in the first domain of the MHC molecule) and other regions of uman and mouse class II genes were examined. In the putative ntigen-recognition site, the rate of nonsynonymous substitution was found to xceed that of synonymous substitution, whereas in the second domain the ormer was significantly lower than the latter. In light of a previous heoretical study and parallel findings in class I MHC loci, we conclude that he unusually high degree of polymorphism at class II MHC loci is caused ainly by overdominant selection (heterozygote advantage) operating in the ntigen-recognition site.},

abstract = {It has sometimes been suggested that the wild-type allele is not a single entity, but rather a population of different isoalleles that are indistinguishable by any ordinary procedure. With hundreds of nucleotides, each presumably cap- T has sometimes been suggested that the wild-type allele is not a single entity, able of base substitutions and with additional permutations possible through se- quence rearrangements, gains, and losses, the number of possible gene states becomes astronomical. It is known that a single nucleotide substitution can have the most drastic consequences, but there are also mutations with very minute effects and there is the possibility that many are so small as to be undetectable. It is not the purpose of this article to discuss the plausibility of such a system of isoalleles, or the evidence for and against. Instead, we propose to examine some of the population consequences of such a system if it does exist. The probability seems great enough to warrant such an inquiry. If a large number of different states can arise by mutation, this doesn't neces- sarily mean that a large fraction of these would coexist in a single population. Some will be lost by random drift and others may be selectively disadvantageous. On the other hand, some may persist by being beneficial in heterozygous combinations. We shall consider three possibilities: (1) A system of selectively neutral isoalleles whose frequency in the population is determined by the mutation rate and by random drift. (2) A system of mutually heterotic alleles. (3) A mixture of heterotic and harmful mutants.},

He first proposed the theory in 1968 to explain the unexpectedly high rate of evolutionary change and very large amount of intraspecific variability at the molecular level that had been uncovered by new techniques in molecular biology. The theory - which asserts that the great majority of evolutionary changes at the molecular level are caused not by Darwinian selection but by random drift of selectively neutral mutants - has caused controversy ever since. This book is the first comprehensive treatment of this subject and the author synthesises a wealth of material - ranging from a historical perspective, through recent molecular discoveries, to sophisticated mathematical arguments - all presented in a most lucid manner.},

@article{Kingman1982,
abstract = {While studies of phylogeography and speciation in the past have largely focused on the documentation or detection of significant patterns of population genetic structure, the emerging field of statistical phylogeography aims to infer the history and processes underlying that structure, and to provide objective, rather than ad hoc explanations. Methods for parameter estimation are now commonly used to make inferences about demographic past. Although these approaches are well developed statistically, they typically pay little attention to geographical history. In contrast, methods that seek to reconstruct phylogeographic history are able to consider many alternative geographical scenarios, but are primarily nonstatistical, making inferences about particular biological processes without explicit reference to stochastically derived expectations. We advocate the merging of these two traditions so that statistical phylogeographic methods can provide an accurate representation of the past, consider a diverse array of processes, and yet yield a statistical estimate of that history. We discuss various conceptual issues associated with statistical phylogeographic inferences, considering especially the stochasticity of population genetic processes and assessing the confidence of phylogeographic conclusions. To this end, we present some empirical examples that utilize a statistical phylogeographic approach, and then by contrasting results from a coalescent-based approach to those from Templeton's nested cladistic analysis (NCA), we illustrate the importance of assessing error. Because NCA does not assess error in its inferences about historical processes or contemporary gene flow, we performed a small-scale study using simulated data to examine how our conclusions might be affected by such unconsidered errors. NCA did not identify the processes used to simulate the data, confusing among deterministic processes and the stochastic sorting of gene lineages. There is as yet insufficent justification of NCA's ability to accurately infer or distinguish among alternative processes. We close with a discussion of some unresolved problems of current statistical phylogeographic methods to propose areas in need of future development.},

abstract = {A no one knows at the present time the kinds and frequencies of variant alleles present in natural populations of any organism, with the exception of certain S pointed out in the first paper of this series (HUBBY and LEWONTIN 1966), special classes of genes. For human populations we know a good deal about certain polymorphisms for blood cell antigens, serum proteins, and metabolic disorders of various kinds but we can hardly regard these, a priori, as typical of the genome as a whole. Clearly we need a method that will randomly sample the genome and detect a major proportion of the individual allelic substitutions that are segre- gating in a population. In our previous paper, we discussed a method for accom- plishing this end by means of a study of electrophoretic variants at a large number of loci and we showed that the variation picked up by this method behaves in a simple Mendelian fashion so that phenotypes can be equated to homozygous and heterozygous genotypes at single loci. It is the purpose of this second paper to show the results of an application of the method to a series of samples chosen from natural populations of Drosophila pseudoobscura. In particular, we will show that there is a considerable amount of genic variation segregating in all of the populations studied and that the real variation in these populations must be greater than we are able to demonstrate. This study does not make clear what balance of forces is responsible for the genetic variation observed, but it does make clear the kind and amount of varia- tion at the genic level that we need to explain. An exactly similar method has recently been applied by HARRIS (1966) for the enzymes of human blood. In a preliminary report on ten randomly chosen enzymes, HARRIS describes two as definitely polymorphic genetically and a third as phenotypically polymorphic but with insufficient genetic data so far. Clearly these methods are applicable to any organism of macroscopic dimensions.},

abstract = {Proteins often differ in amino-acid sequence across species. This difference has  evolved by the accumulation of neutral mutations by random drift, the fixation of adaptive mutations by selection, or a mixture of the two. Here we propose a simple statistical test of the neutral protein evolution hypothesis based on a comparison of the number of amino-acid replacement substitutions to synonymous substitutions in the coding region of a locus. If the observed substitutions are neutral, the ratio of replacement to synonymous fixed differences between species should be the same as the ratio of replacement to synonymous polymorphisms within species. DNA sequence data on the Adh locus (encoding alcohol dehydrogenase, EC 1.1.1.1) in three species in the Drosophila melanogaster species subgroup do not fit this expectation; instead, there are more fixed replacement differences between species than expected. We suggest that these excess replacement substitutions result from adaptive fixation of selectively advantageous mutations.},

abstract = {The network architecture of streams and rivers constrains evolutionary, demographic and ecological processes of freshwater organisms. This consistent architecture also makes stream networks useful for testing general models of population genetic structure and the scaling of gene flow. We examined genetic structure and gene flow in the facultatively paedomorphic Idaho giant salamander, Dicamptodon aterrimus, in stream networks of Idaho and Montana, USA. We used microsatellite data to test population structure models by (i) examining hierarchical partitioning of genetic variation in stream networks; and (ii) testing for genetic isolation by distance along stream corridors vs. overland pathways. Replicated sampling of streams within catchments within three river basins revealed that hierarchical scale had strong effects on genetic structure and gene flow. amova identified significant structure at all hierarchical scales (among streams, among catchments, among basins), but divergence among catchments had the greatest structural influence. Isolation by distance was detected within catchments, and in-stream distance was a strong predictor of genetic divergence. Patterns of genetic divergence suggest that differentiation among streams within catchments was driven by limited migration, consistent with a stream hierarchy model of population structure. However, there was no evidence of migration among catchments within basins, or among basins, indicating that gene flow only counters the effects of genetic drift at smaller scales (within rather than among catchments). These results show the strong influence of stream networks on population structure and genetic divergence of a salamander, with contrasting effects at different hierarchical scales.},

abstract = {Determining the extent of adaptive evolution at the genomic level is central to our understanding of molecular evolution. A suitable observation for this purpose would consist of polymorphic data on a large and unbiased collection of genes from two closely related species, each having a large and stable population. In this study, we sequenced 419 genes from 24 lines of Drosophila melanogaster and its close relatives. Together with data from Drosophila simulans, these data reveal the following. (i) Approximately 10{\%} of the loci in regions of normal recombination are much less polymorphic at silent sites than expected, hinting at the action of selective sweeps. (ii) The level of polymorphism is negatively correlated with the rate of nonsynonymous divergence across loci. Thus, even under strict neutrality, the ratio of amino acid to silent nucleotide changes (A:S) between Drosophila species is expected to be 25-40{\%} higher than the A:S ratio for polymorphism when data are pooled across the genome. (iii) The observed A/S ratio between species among the 419 loci is 28.9{\%} higher than the (adjusted) neutral expectation. We estimate that nearly 30{\%} of the amino acid substitutions between D. melanogaster and its close relatives were adaptive. (iv) This signature of adaptive evolution is observable only in regions of normal recombination. Hence, the low level of polymorphism observed in regions of reduced recombination may not be driven primarily by positive selection. Finally, we discuss the theories and data pertaining to the interpretation of adaptive evolution in genomic studies.},

@article{Shoemaker1999,
abstract = {Statistical analyses are used in many fields of genetic research. Most geneticists are taught classical statistics, which includes hypothesis testing, estimation and the construction of confidence intervals; this framework has proved more than satisfactory in many ways. What does a Bayesian framework have to offer geneticists? Its utility lies in offering a more direct approach to some questions and the incorporation of prior information. It can also provide a more straightforward interpretation of results. The utility of a Bayesian perspective, especially for complex problems, is becoming increasingly clear to the statistics community; geneticists are also finding this framework useful and are increasingly utilizing the power of this approach.},

@article{Tajima1989,
abstract = {The relationship between the two estimates of genetic variation at the DNA level, namely the number of segregating sites and the average number of nucleotide differences estimated from pairwise comparison, is investigated. It is found that the correlation between these two estimates is large when the sample size is small, and decreases slowly as the sample size increases. Using the relationship obtained, a statistical method for testing the neutral mutation hypothesis is developed. This method needs only the data of DNA polymorphism, namely the genetic variation within population at the DNA level. A simple method of computer simulation, that was used in order to obtain the distribution of a new statistic developed, is also presented. Applying this statistical method to the five regions of DNA sequences in Drosophila melanogaster, it is found that large insertion/deletion (greater than 100 bp) is deleterious. It is suggested that the natural selection against large insertion/deletion is so weak that a large amount of variation is maintained in a population.},

@article{Watterson1978,
abstract = {An earlier paper showed that the homozygosity (of a population or sample) was a good statistic for testing departures from selective neutrality in the direction of heterozygote advantage or disadvantage. It is here shown that homozygosity is also influenced by the presence of deleterious alleles and by other departures from neutrality, but at a lower order of magnitude of effect if the selection coefficients are of the same small order of magnitude. Tables are provided for the significance points and moments of the homozygosity, under the null hypothesis of neutrality.},

@article{Watterson1977,
abstract = {Various statistics have been proposed on an ad hoc basis to test whether alleles at a locus are selectively neutral. By considering population models in which selection operates, this paper shows that the population homozygosity is a powerful test statistic for testing departures from neutrality, in the direction of heterozygote advantage or disadvantage. The sample homozygosity plays a similar role when only sample data are available. Some numerical examples are included, showing the application of the test.--An analysis is made of the effect of heterosis on such quantities as the expected number of alleles in the population or sample, the effective number of alleles, the expected homozygosity, and on the population and sample allele frequency distributions generally.},

@article{Weir2008,
abstract = {Linkage disequilibrium refers to the association between alleles at different loci. The standard definition applies to two alleles in the same gamete, and it can be regarded as the covariance of indicator variables for the states of those two alleles. The corresponding correlation coefficient rho is the parameter that arises naturally in discussions of tests of association between markers and genetic diseases. A general treatment of association tests makes use of the additive and nonadditive components of variance for the disease gene. In almost all expressions that describe the behavior of association tests, additive variance components are modified by the squared correlation coefficient rho2 and the nonadditive variance components by rho4, suggesting that nonadditive components have less influence than additive components on association tests.},
