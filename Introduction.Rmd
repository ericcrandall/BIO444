### Background

The text written here is just that - text as you would enter it into a word processor.  When this document is compiled ("knitted") it will be formated like any other text.  Code to be executed needs to be inserted in a "chunk" (opt-cmd-I)

```{r}
x <-2*2
x
```
Now we will do a plot.  We'll create two vectors v1 and v2, and make an xy plot of them

```{r}
v1=c(1:4)
v2=c(2,4,6,8)
plot(v1,v2)
```
