### Background

Effective population size is a widely used concept - `r citet("10.1038/nrg2526")` has written an excellent introduction to the subject.  Furthermore, in Table 3 of that paper (below) he summarizes some estimates made of Ne based on nucleotide sequence data.  We will work through a couple of those examples.

### Humans and Apes

The question of the effective population sizes of humans and the great apes was considered by `r citet("10.1534/genetics.166.3.1375")` in a fairly straightforward way, using the Tajima estimator to do so:

&pi; = 4Ne&mu;

It takes only trivial algebraic rearrangement to recognize that

Ne = &pi;/4&mu;

We can calculate &pi; from nucleotide sequence data; the question is what to use for &mu;.  One very approximate way to get at that would be to divide the percent divergence between to species by 2t, where t is the estimated time of divergence.  We can do that for humans and chimpanzees as follows:

```{r}
td <-6000000
nucdiv <- .0129
mu <-nucdiv/(2*td)
mu
```
Note that this is a yearly mutation rate; to get the per generation rate, we need to multiply it by the average number of years per generation (20 in humans):

```{r}
mu.hum <-mu*20
```

Now, looking at 10 nuclear genes, Yu et al found the average value of &pi; to be .087.  Using these value, we can then calculate Ne as follows:

```{r}
pi.hum <-.00087
n.hum <-pi.hum/(4*mu.hum)
n.hum
```
And we come up with the surprisingly low figure of `r as.integer(n.hum)` (note that the estimate of &mu; they used was slightly different, as it was calculated based on divergence among gorillas, chimpanzees and humans, not just the latter two taxa).

### E. coli

This quesion is addressed by Charlesworth and Eyre-Walker `r citep("10.1093/molbev/msk025")`, using synonymous differences in 10 genes.  In this case, the estimate &theta; (using the Watterson estimator) was 0.76; the mutation rate had previously been estimated to be 5X10^-10/nucleotide per generation.  Our estimate of Ne can thus be made by

```{r}
th.ecoli <-.78
mu.ecoli <-5*10^(-10)
n.ecoli <-th.ecoli/(4*mu.ecoli*2)
n.ecoli
```
