Continuing on our effort to build the functional capabilities of sum_stats into pure R, we'll need to work on the Fay Wu H statistic.  The key is getting the unfolded SFS and doing appropriate manipulations.  Note that this is a preliminary version that needs fleshing out; not sure whether we'll use it this year.



#### Simulation
```{r}
dat <-ms(nsam=100,nreps=1,opts=("-t 10"))
dat.ms <-read.ms.output(txt=dat)
gams <-dat.ms$gametes[[1]]
```

#### Getting the Site Frequency Spectrum
```{r}
sf <-sfs(gams)
```
#### And calculating the statistics
```{r}
pi.s <-pi(sf)
th <-theta.H(sf)
h <-pi.s-th
pi.s;th;h
```
